# Website-Services-Section

## Objective
Build a simple website services section.

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository and name it "Website-Services-Section".

2. Create an HTML and CSS layout for a services section on a website. 
The section should showcase different services offered by a fictional company. 
Use appropriate HTML elements and apply CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the section. 

3. Create an HTML structure that includes a container element to hold the services section.

4. Within the container, create individual service cards to represent each service offered. Each service card should include the following elements:

- Service title
- Service description
- Service icon or image representing the service.

5. Apply CSS styles to the service cards to make them visually appealing. 
Consider using CSS properties like background color, box shadow, padding, margin, and font styles to enhance the design.

6. Display the service cards in a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. 
Ensure that the cards are evenly distributed and responsive to different screen sizes.

7. Apply hover effects to the service cards to provide visual feedback when the user interacts with them. 
For example, change the background color or add a subtle animation.

8. Use appropriate CSS techniques to align and style the text content within the service cards. 
Consider using typography styles, text alignment, and spacing to make the information visually appealing and readable.

9. Implement media queries to make the services section responsive. 
Ensure that the layout and design adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, such as mobile devices and tablets.

10. Push to Github and share the link to the repo on Microsoft Teams
